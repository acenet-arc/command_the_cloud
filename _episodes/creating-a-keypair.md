teaching: 20
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How can I see what OpenStack commands are possible?"
- "How can I get more information about a particular OpenStack command?"
- "How do you create a keypair?"
- "How do you use the OpenStack CLI to upload a public key to your cloud?"
objectives:
- "Navigate the OpenStack CLI help documentation."
- "Create a public/private keypair to use for authentication with a virtual machine."
- "Upload public key to OpenStack cloud so that it can be injected into new virtual machines."
keypoints:
- "OpenStack command can be used for one off commands by prefixing with `openstack` or a series of commands by first running `openstack` command without any sub commands giving an `(openstack)` prompt."
- "Virtual Machines usually use public/private keypairs to authenticate securely."
- "You can upload a public key to your OpenStack cloud that will be injected into a newly created virtual machine."

As a first task for using our newly setup OpenStack CLI, lets create a new virtual machine. However, in order to access it we will first need to have a keypair created and the public key setup with our OpenStack account so that it can be injected into newly created virtual machines.

We can generate a new key pair to use when we create new virtual machines using `ssh-keygen` command.

~~~
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user03/.ssh/id_ed25519):
~~~
{: .output}
Press enter to accept that filename.
~~~
Created directory '/home/user03/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
~~~
{: .output}
It is a good idea to enter a passphrase to protect your private keys. You will not see the characters you type for your passphrase. **Make sure it is something you can easily remember**, we will need to use it later.
~~~
Enter same passphrase again:
~~~
{: .output}
Enter your passphrase again go confirm.
~~~
Your public key has been saved in /home/user03/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:WVLtnV1/8/dp77wexgzexwwlkg6G0LIFLInDx5NbI9M user03@ctc
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
| . o =oo  ..     |
|  + X E.oo  ..  .|
|   o B =o +.o..o+|
|    . .  = o..o++|
|        S   ... +|
|            . =+o|
|             . *B|
|              .++|
|              o+*|
+----[SHA256]-----+

Now that we have created a public/private keypair, we need to send the public key to OpenStack. Lets see if we can find an OpenStack CLI command to do that.

To find more information about the `openstack` command you can type `openstack help` which produces a huge amount of text describing how the command can be used, all of the available options, and a list of sub commands.
~~~
$ openstack help
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
usage: openstack [--version] [-v | -q] [--log-file LOG_FILE] [-h]
                 [--debug] [--os-cloud <cloud-config-name>]
                 [--os-region-name <auth-region-name>]

...

options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -v, --verbose         Increase verbosity of output. Can be repeated.
  -q, --quiet           Suppress output except warnings and errors.
  --log-file LOG_FILE
                        Specify a file to log output. Disabled by default.
  -h, --help            Show help message and exit.

...

Commands:
  access rule delete  Delete access rule(s)
  access rule list  List access rules

...

  keypair create  Create new public or private key for server ssh access

...

You can get additional information about a particular command by typing `openstack help` followed by the command.
~~~
$ openstack help keypair create
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
usage: openstack keypair create [-h] [-f {json,shell,table,value,yaml}]
                                [-c COLUMN] [--noindent] [--prefix PREFIX]
                                [--max-width <integer>] [--fit-width] [--print-empty]
                                [--public-key <file> | --private-key <file>]
                                [--type <type>] [--user <user>]
                                [--user-domain <user-domain>]
                                <name>

Create new public or private key for server ssh access

positional arguments:
  <name>        New public or private key name

> ## OpenStack Command Permissions
> There are many commands listed with `openstack help` some of which, as a regular user of the cloud, you have permission to use and others require administrative permissions to use. If you attempt to use a command requiring administration permissions you might see error messages such as these below.
> 
> ~~~
> ForbiddenException: 403: Client Error for url: https://arbutus.cloud.computecanada.ca:####/v#.#/XXXXXX, Policy doesn't allow XXXXXX:XXXXXX to be performed.

{: .callout}

We can then upload our newly created public key to our OpenStack cloud using the `keypair create` command.
~~~
$ openstack keypair create --public-key ./.ssh/id_ed25519.pub ctc-workshop
~~~
{: .bash}

Public keys are specific to the OpenStack user account and not the OpenStack project.
