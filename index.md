Cloud computing has become very popular recently. Part of the reason for this popularity is that it provides great flexibility allowing complete control of the computing environment. In addition the environment can be copied, backed up, created and recreated in an automated way. In this lesson we will take the next step in learning to use OpenStack clouds and introduce the OpenStack Command Line Interface (CLI). This CLI allows you to perform the same tasks as you would normally with on the OpenStack Dashboard, but from the command line allowing some amount of automation through scripts. In addition the OpenStack CLI allows you to gain information and perform tasks that you can not simply by using the OpenStack dashboard.
